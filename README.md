# Metrics Simulation and Dynamic Data Generation Script

This Python script simulates metrics within specified ranges and sends the corresponding log messages along with dynamic geolocation and network data to a designated HTTP endpoint. The script is fully configurable via a `config.json` file.

## Configuration

Before running the script, ensure you have a `config.json` file in the same directory. This file allows you to specify various parameters for the script, including:

1. **Metrics Definition**: Define each metric's name, range, and log message thresholds.
2. **Hostnames**: Specify a list of hostnames to be used for metrics, or leave it empty to generate hostnames dynamically.
3. **HTTP Endpoint and Token**: Set the HTTP endpoint and token for data submission.
4. **Sleep Time**: Configure how frequently (in seconds) data is generated and sent.

### Example Structure of config.json
```json
{
  "metrics": [
    {
      "name": "Metric1",
      "range": {"min": 10, "max": 50},
      "thresholds": [
        {"min": 10, "max": 20, "type": "Error", "message": "Value is between 10 and 20 for Metric1"},
        {"min": 21, "max": 30, "type": "Success", "message": "Value is between 21 and 30 for Metric1"},
        {"min": 31, "max": 40, "type": "Status", "message": "Value is between 31 and 40 for Metric1"}
      ],
      "source": "Node1"
    }
  ],
  "hosts": ["host1.example.com", "host2.example.com"],
  "httpEndpoint": "https://############.collect.observeinc.com/v1/http",
  "token": "YOUR TOKEN",
  "sleepTime": 1
}
```

## Dependencies

Install the required dependencies by running:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Functions

- **`read_config(config_path)`**: Reads and parses the `config.json` file from the specified path and returns the configuration as a dictionary. This is where all initial settings are loaded.
- **`simulate_metric_value(metric)`**: Simulates a random value for a given metric based on its defined range (min and max). This function ensures variability in metric values for realism.
- **`determine_log_message(metric, value)`**: Determines the appropriate log message for a metric value based on predefined thresholds. This function checks if the value falls within specified ranges and selects the corresponding message.
- **`initialize_metric_info(metric, config_hosts)`**: Initializes the hostname, IP address, and geolocation data for each metric. If `config_hosts` is provided, it selects a hostname from this list; otherwise, it generates one dynamically using Faker.
- **`choose_hostname(config_hosts)`**: Selects a hostname from the provided `config_hosts` array. If the array is empty, dynamic generation is triggered.
- **`send_data(endpoint, token, data)`**: Sends the simulated data to the configured HTTP endpoint using the specified authorization token. It formats the data as JSON and includes necessary headers.
- **`main()`**: The main function orchestrates the entire process. It initializes metric information, continuously generates metric values, determines corresponding log messages, and sends the data to the HTTP endpoint, respecting the sleep time set in the configuration.

## Using This GPT

To customize your `config.json` file for the script, you can use this GPT, which was created by Chris Milton, an SE at Observe Inc. The GPT helps to fill in values, add additional metrics, or modify log information in the config file.

### How to Use

1. **Start by interacting with the GPT** to specify your customization needs.
2. **Ask the GPT to make specific customizations.** For example, if you want to adjust CPU ranges, specify the desired min and max values, and the GPT will handle the adjustments for you.
3. **Ask the GPT to tailor the script for a specifc scenario or to display specifc behavior.** For example, you could ask the GPT to simulate a DDOS attack every 5 minutes, or to tailor the script for a manufacturing scenario, etc.  Use your imagination.
4. **The GPT will display the updated config file and ask if you'd like to see the complete file.** You can review the changes and ensure they meet your requirements.
5. **Copy the customized config file** and save it in the same directory as the script.

### Example Interactions
- **You**: "I want to adjust the CPU ranges."
- **GPT**: "For CPU, you can customize the minimum and maximum ranges, log message thresholds, and log conditions. What values would you like to set for the min and max ranges?"
- **You**: "Set min to 5 and max to 95."
- **GPT**: "The CPU range has been updated. Would you like to see the complete config file?"

### GPT Customization Capabilities

The GPT provides a highly dynamic and customizable approach to configuring the script. This allows you to tailor the script for various specific use cases, such as:

- **IT Processes**: Configure the script to monitor server performance metrics like CPU usage, memory usage, and disk I/O, with specific log messages for different thresholds.
- **Manufacturing Processes**: Customize the script to simulate metrics like machine temperature, production speed, and error rates, generating logs that reflect the operational status of manufacturing equipment.
- **Healthcare Processes**: Adjust the script to track patient vitals, medication administration rates, and equipment usage, ensuring detailed logs for different health status indicators.

With the help of the GPT, you can retool the script to be applicable for many different scenarios, providing flexibility and precision in generating simulated data for testing and monitoring purposes.
